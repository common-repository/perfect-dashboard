Let’s face it. Updates often cause display errors. Testing website manually can be very time consuming. With our Genuine Test Engine you can be more efficient. Perfect Dashboard will perform website test for you and point out where are possible display errors.

Genuine Test Engine analyses all changes in website layout, but also checks if all Social & SEO Tags are still in place. And it works with every website in the Internet.

You don’t have a backup unless you know you can use it for website restoration. Restoring every website copy and checking it’s integrity is boring and takes ages. But we want you to be able to concentrate on more important tasks.

That’s why we give one-click backup that start a chain of actions which includes coping website, remote restoration, integrity testing and storing backup at chosen storage location. And that’s it.

(coming this winter)

Editing CMS core files is a bad practice & editing extensions code is not recommended. But there are cases in which it’s difficult to customize website to client’s needs without it. That’s why Perfect Dashboard comes with a Custom Changes Detector.

It scans entire code for any modifications. Thanks to that you don’t need to remember yourself to copy these parts of the code to the updated website code. What is more, we provide resources on how to implement these modifications along with good practices, to save you time the next time you will do update.
